In this dataset find dependent and independent variable and write codes for support vector machine classifier by taking training size is 70% and remaining for testing and check the accuracy.



Tools used – pandas, exploratory data analysis, label encoder, sklearn, support vector machine (classifier), matplotlib, seaborn.



Outcome – the accuracy of support vector machine (classifier) is 86% and 4,219 and 1,798 these are true positive classes and 534 and 401 are false positive classes. here predicted variable is recommended.
